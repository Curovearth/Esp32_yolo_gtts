# About the Project

Hi! We present you all **THE THIRD EYE aka T3E** which is a prototype made to make a change in the lives of the blind people who after so much tech advancement still face problems. 
We are using Yolo V3 object detection and Classifier to classify the surroundings and with the help of GTTS or **Google's Text to Speech Conversion** we aware the person about the forthcoming environment which will aware and alert the person wearing our prototype.


# What did we use?

We used **AI THINKER ESP32 CAM** as our source for real time video streaming which is attached to our prototype and then with the help of arduino we further made it work as a Camera Web Server where we embedded our code.

## Future Goals

Being an AI enthusiasts and a tech geeks we look forward on making it much more user friendly for the blind wherein we could use much more cost effective cams and we can also use the distance measurement between the person wearing it and the object in the surrounding which will be much more useful. We look forward to change their lives and make them more happy.

## Working ---> How to proceed ?

 1. [Setting up esp32 on arduino ide](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/) ...... This really helped us a lot.
 2. Try installing the required libraries first to run obj_det.py
 3. I must warn you guys that we faced a lot of problems related to streaming the video from esp32 cam so please make sure you have a stable network connection along with a good processor, if it's not good then no problem you could see but it will tend to lag a lot.
 4. Make sure to download  yolov3 weights from
https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights to the same folder.

Have Fun using this and remember **every person can make a difference in someone's life.**
